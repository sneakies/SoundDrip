# sound-drip

### Usage:

```
python sound_drip.py -u username_goes_here
```

* no additional libraries needed, works with what your mama gave you
* files will download to the same directory where `sound_drip.py` exists
* you can start and stop the script as you wish, it will check to see if the mp3 exists before attempting to download it


### Why:

```
Rumor has it soundcloud is hemoraging money and will shut down by Dec 2017 at the latest
http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/soundcloud-may-run-out-of-cash-this-year-as-it-posts-e51m-loss/
This is my backup plan.

Script accepts a username and downloads all tracks "liked" by the user as mp3s
